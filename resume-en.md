## Experience

### Senior Frontend Software Engineer, Meituan

Aug 2023 - Jul 2024 | Beijing, China

**UI PaaS - Core Contributor**

*Worked on a **UI PaaS platform** integrating common features of CRM and BI low-code systems; **contributed to core frontend architecture** with a focus on **extensibility, feature efficiency, and user experience**, enhancing the **UI builder** with multi-tab editing, reusable components, real-time collaboration, and internationalization.*

- Enhanced the low-code platform’s **drag-and-drop UI builder** with reusable components (React, TypeScript, and MobX) and customization panels, enabling non-technical users to design applications faster and with greater flexibility.
- Designed and implemented a **VS Code–style multi-tab editing interface**, allowing users to edit multiple pages within a single browser tab. This reduced redundant page reloads, improved browser performance, and streamlined workflow.
- Enhanced the **core rendering engine** to support multiple editing contexts (pages, flows, iframes), laying the foundation for future editing modes beyond the page UI builder.
- Developed a custom 'segment' system for shared components, enabling changes to common parts to propagate across multiple pages automatically, instead of editing each page individually.
- Built **tab lifecycle management** with communication channels to handle tab types, synchronize state, and trigger re-renders at the correct times.

**Tech Stack:** React, TypeScript, MobX, Ant Design, Lowcode, REST APIs, i18n frameworks
